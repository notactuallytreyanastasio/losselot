# Losselot

**Audio forensics meets AI-assisted development.**

Losselot started as a tool to detect fake lossless audio files. It evolved into something more: a living experiment in how AI and humans can build software together, with every decision tracked and queryable.

## What This Project Is

**Two things at once:**

1. **An Audio Forensics Tool** - Detect if your FLAC/WAV files are actually transcoded from MP3s. Uses spectral analysis, binary metadata parsing, and lo-fi detection to expose the truth.

2. **A Living Museum** - Every algorithm choice, every rejected approach, every "why did we do it this way?" is captured in a queryable decision graph. Watch the project evolve in real-time.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/notactuallytreyanastasio/losselot.git
cd losselot

## The Verdicts

| Verdict | Score | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **CLEAN** | 0-34 | Genuine lossless - natural frequency content |
| **SUSPECT** | 35-64 | Something's off - investigate further |
| **TRANSCODE** | 65-100 | Fake lossless - clear compression damage |

### How Detection Works

#### Spectral Analysis

Lossy codecs remove high frequencies to save space. The "scars" are permanent:

| Source | Typical Cutoff |
|--------|----------------|
| 128kbps MP3 | ~16kHz |
| 192kbps MP3 | ~18kHz |
| 320kbps MP3 | ~20kHz |
| True Lossless | ~22kHz |

#### Binary Analysis (MP3)

For MP3 files, we read encoder metadata (LAME headers). A "320kbps" file with a 16kHz lowpass was definitely transcoded from 128kbps - the encoder honestly reports what it kept.

#### Lo-Fi Detection (CFCC)

Not all high-frequency rolloff is compression damage. Tape recordings have natural rolloff.

**The difference:**
- **MP3**: Brick-wall cutoff at fixed frequency
- **Tape**: Gradual rolloff that varies with dynamics

We use Cross-Frequency Coherence (CFCC) to distinguish them.

#### Re-encoding Detection

Multiple encoder signatures = multiple lossy passes = cumulative damage. We detect LAME, FFmpeg, Fraunhofer, and chains between them.

### Detection Flags

**Spectral:**
- `severe_hf_damage` - Major frequency loss
- `hf_cutoff_detected` - Clear lossy cutoff found
- `dead_ultrasonic_band` - No content above 20kHz

**Re-encoding:**
- `multi_encoder_sigs` - Multiple encoders detected
- `encoding_chain(LAME → FFmpeg)` - Specific chain identified
- `lame_reencoded_x2` - Re-encoded through LAME twice

### Supported Formats

FLAC, WAV, AIFF, MP3, M4A, AAC, OGG, Opus, ALAC

<summary><b>Decision Graph & Memory System</b></summary>

### The Problem

Claude (and LLMs generally) lose context. Sessions end, memory compacts, decisions evaporate. Six months later, no one remembers *why* we chose CFCC over temporal variance analysis.

### The Solution

Every decision is tracked in a queryable graph that persists forever:

```bash
# See all decisions ever made
./target/release/losselot db nodes

# See how they connect
./target/release/losselot db edges

# Full graph as JSON
./target/release/losselot db graph
```

### Node Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Goal** | High-level objectives |
| **Decision** | Choice points with options |
| **Option** | Approaches considered |
| **Action** | What was implemented |
| **Outcome** | What happened |
| **Observation** | Technical insights |

### Confidence Weights

Every node can have a confidence score (0-100):

```bash
# Add with confidence
./target/release/losselot db add-node -t decision "Use CFCC" -c 85
```

- **70-100**: High confidence - proven approach
- **40-69**: Medium - reasonable, some uncertainty
- **0-39**: Low - experimental

### Commit Linking

Link decisions to specific code changes:

```bash
./target/release/losselot db add-node -t action "Implemented feature" -c 90 --commit abc123
```

The demo UI shows clickable commit badges that link to GitHub.

### Why This Matters

- **Queryable history**: "Why didn't we use temporal variance?" → search the graph
- **Rejected approaches preserved**: What *didn't* work is as valuable as what did
- **Code-decision traceability**: Every commit linked to its reasoning
- **Survives context loss**: The graph outlives any session

<summary><b>Claude Integration & CLAUDE.md</b></summary>

### The CLAUDE.md Contract

The project includes a `CLAUDE.md` file that tells Claude:

1. **Always start by reading the decision graph** - recover context
2. **Log everything** - observations, decisions, actions, outcomes
3. **Link commits to decisions** - full traceability
4. **Sync the graph before deploying** - keep the live site current

### Makefile Shortcuts

```bash
# Decision Graph Commands
make obs T="Found interesting pattern" C=80     # Observation
make decision T="Choose approach" C=70          # Decision point
make action T="Implemented fix" C=95            # Implementation
make outcome T="Tests pass" C=90                # Result
make link FROM=1 TO=2 REASON="because"          # Connect nodes
make sync-graph                                 # Export to live site

# Web Viewer Commands (React + TypeScript + Vite)
make web                # Sync graph data and start dev server
make web-dev            # Start dev server at http://localhost:3001
make web-build          # Build production bundle
make web-typecheck      # Run TypeScript type checking
make web-test           # Run web tests
```

**Note:** All commands should be run via `make` targets. This is the primary entrypoint for Claude skills and automation.

### TypeScript Types

The frontend has TypeScript types mirroring the Rust backend:

- `DecisionNode`, `DecisionEdge`, `GraphData` (graph.ts)
- `AnalysisResult`, `BinaryAnalysis`, `SpectralAnalysis` (analysis.ts)

Tests run in CI alongside Rust tests.

### The Living Museum Concept

This isn't documentation written after the fact. It's a real-time record of how software gets built - captured as decisions happen, not reconstructed from memory later.

## The Story

Losselot started as "does this FLAC actually contain lossless audio?" and evolved into "can we build software in a way where every decision is preserved, queryable, and linked to code?"

The audio forensics works great. But the real experiment is whether decision graphs can solve the "why did we do it this way?" problem that plagues every long-running project.
